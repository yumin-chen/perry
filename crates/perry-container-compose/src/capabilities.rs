//! Backend capabilities + spec normalization.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists
//!
//! Perry's `ContainerSpec` and `ComposeSpec` are *abstractions over OCI*,
//! but the four backends Perry can pick at runtime — Docker, Podman,
//! apple/container, Lima/nerdctl — diverge sharply on which features
//! they actually support. A spec written for Docker that sets
//! `privileged: true` and `seccomp: "/etc/seccomp.json"` is meaningless
//! on apple/container (no privileged mode, no seccomp profiles); silently
//! emitting those flags produces opaque CLI errors at runtime, and
//! silently dropping them produces a **less secure** container than the
//! user asked for, with no signal that the policy wasn't honored.
//!
//! The fix is a three-layer dance:
//!
//! 1. **Capabilities** — every backend declares what it actually supports
//!    in a `BackendCapabilities` struct. This is the contract: the
//!    feature names are stable across backends, but the values diverge.
//!
//! 2. **Normalization** — before the orchestrator hands a `ContainerSpec`
//!    to a `CliProtocol::run_args`, it runs `normalise_spec_for(backend,
//!    spec)`. This pass either (a) translates the feature to the
//!    backend's closest equivalent (e.g., docker `--security-opt seccomp=
//!    file` → podman `--security-opt seccomp=file` ✅; apple drop with
//!    warning), (b) emits a structured `NormalizationWarning` the
//!    orchestrator surfaces to the user, or (c) raises a hard error if
//!    the user opted into `enforcement: Strict` mode.
//!
//! 3. **Conformance test suite** — `tests/conformance.rs` runs the same
//!    arg-shape assertions against every protocol's `run_args` /
//!    `create_args` / `list_args` / etc. The "did backend N emit the
//!    same shape as backend M?" question becomes a CI-blocking unit
//!    test, not a runtime surprise.
//!
//! ## Determinism guarantees
//!
//! Given the same `ComposeSpec`, normalise-then-emit produces:
//!
//! - **Same containers, same names, same labels, same volumes/networks**
//!   on every backend. Project-namespacing (`<project>_<name>`) and
//!   service-key network aliases are computed at the engine layer above
//!   the protocol, so they're invariant.
//! - **Best-effort feature parity** for security flags: features that
//!   land natively on the target runtime are emitted; features that
//!   don't are either translated (Docker's `--read-only` ↔ apple's
//!   `--read-only`), dropped with warning, or hard-rejected.
//! - **JSON output normalization** at the parse layer: `parse_list_output`
//!   on every protocol returns the **same `ContainerInfo` struct** with
//!   the same field semantics — so user code reading `info.status` sees
//!   `"running"` from any backend, not `"Up 5 seconds"` from docker
//!   vs `"running"` from apple.
//!
//! ## What this module does NOT solve
//!
//! - **Network plugin model** — apple/container's network plugin needs
//!   `container system start`; Docker daemons need to be running. Both
//!   are operational state, not feature state, so they're caught by
//!   `check_available()` in the existing trait.
//! - **Performance characteristics** — apple/container runs in a VM,
//!   Docker on macOS runs in a VM, podman rootless runs in user-namespace.
//!   Container startup time and disk I/O speed differ; that's outside
//!   the scope of "did the spec reach the runtime intact".
//! - **Image registry auth** — each backend has its own credential helper
//!   (docker `~/.docker/config.json`, podman `~/.config/containers/auth.
//!   json`, apple's keychain integration). Auth is operational state
//!   handled by the runtime; Perry doesn't try to bridge.
